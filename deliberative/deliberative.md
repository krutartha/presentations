### Bharatiya Janata Party

It is totally justified to call India as Bharat!

--

#### The Constitution of India
`$$ Bharat = India $$`

        <p class="text-lg">“In 1950, four years after the publication of [India], the drafters of the Constitution of [India] decided how the country should be known. In the opening article of the Constitution of India they wrote: ‘India, that is Bharat, shall be a Union of States’" (Clémentin-Ojha 2)

### Bharatiya Janata Party

It is central to the ethos of this land and is an important step towards bring the nation together into a strong united force (Saaliq).

### Indian National Congress
Not only is it anti-secular to do the renaming, it is also an indication of the failing ruling party! 

--

Use of Bharat in the G20 invitations is a clear divisive strategy to create divisions in India. (“We can always give a second name”). 

--

### Indian National Congress
Claims that the Sanskrit language was and continues to be a “hindu language” so it can’t be a secular approach (“We can always give a second name”)

--

The recent alliance INC formed with other small parties has caused fear to BJP. (“We can always give a second name”)

### Religious Minorities
The religious minoroties, primarily the Muslims and the Christians, have somewhat of a mixed opinion...

--

Some members of the community feel “wholly subordinated to the Hindu Nation, claiming nothing, deserving no privileges, far less any preferential treatment—not even citizen’s rights.” (Kaur)

        <p class="text-lg">They believe that the word Bharat is a word that is introduced in the "hindu" epic Mahabharata in which king Bharata is the ruler of the Bharata dynasty (Kaur)

### Religious Minorities
Some spokepersons believe that the renaming of India to Bharat will have very minor implications, if any.

--

Annie Peters, department of philosophy at St. Stephen’s College, University of Delhi, said: “As Christians, our hope and trust are anchored in Christ Jesus, irrespective of the shifting political landscape or debates surrounding the nation’s name,” (Kaur)
